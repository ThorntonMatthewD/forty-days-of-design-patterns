# Forty Days of Design Patterns
[![CI](https://github.com/ThorntonMatthewD/forty-days-of-design-patterns/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/ThorntonMatthewD/forty-days-of-design-patterns/actions/workflows/ci.yml) ![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/ThorntonMatthewD/forty-days-of-design-patterns/master)

I am currently working through the wealth of knowledge contained within [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/design-patterns-elements/0201633612/) by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides, and while their explanations are well-thought out and communicated masterfully, I find myself struggling to fully grasp each concept to a level where I could comfortably summarize it to a stranger (or my cat). In this repository I will be chronicling my journey towards understanding the twenty-three design patterns detailed in this book. My goal is to complete the book and have a functional example of each pattern, all being showcased here on this page, by the end of a forty day period. Wish me luck!
